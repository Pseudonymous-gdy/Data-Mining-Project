# Project 2: Mall Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project is about customer segmentation in a mall. The goal is to segment the mall customers into different groups based on their shopping behavior and preferences. The dataset used for this project is the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset, which contains information about the mall customers such as age, gender, annual income, spending score, and the mall they visited.

## Start-ups
To start up for environment setup, you need to run the following in the command line:
```bash
pip install yellowbrick sklearn matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
```

## How to execute codes
To execute the codes, you need to run the following jupyter notebooks:
- Preprocessing.ipynb
- clustering.ipynb
- notebook.ipynb

## File Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- README.md: This file contains information about the project.
- Preprocessing.ipynb: This notebook contains the code for preprocessing the dataset.
- clustering.ipynb: This notebook contains the code for clustering the mall customers.
- notebook.ipynb: This notebook contains the code for visualizing the results of the clustering.
